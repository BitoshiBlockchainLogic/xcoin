The Bit as in bits and Bytes of the coin are now free to roam our pockets. lol  

  

Even though the design Brochure says final, that was me trying to put an end to save 1 save 2 and so on. 

I have made a few additions and alterations of my own so I do realise this project “needs work” but the idea is there. I think this will give us the freedom we were looking for when it comes to digital currencies. I have designed it this way because of the current limitations on hardware size. And so the end result is a lot like normal money. We can lock it to users accounts or we can let it Rome free on an rfid chipped note or coin..... and have another device as signage at the end of day or money with switches … oh, my latest was creating the coin and then signing it using users finger print as input to generate keys. And so now we can shop with our faces and fingers too..  My idea allows coins to sign or latch themselves onto something and so the main idea is that crypto can be withdrawn and deposited.  If theres something you think that makes this impossible let me know ill prove you wrong. Thanks :) 

The Beginninhg of a long road, be warned im unpredictable and sad ... dono how else to put it, So feel welcome to join each other and me on this long journey to see what we may find.
